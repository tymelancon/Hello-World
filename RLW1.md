**Introduction**

My name is Ty James MelancÇ«n. I worked in the IT industry for about eight years. I love cooking, reading, 
playing/recording music, playing D&D, and gaming of all sorts. 

**Inital Understanding**

When I initially walked in the idea was that Technical Writing was more about writing in a business setting. 
While that can be true the real intent was left untouched. 

**Reflection**

When setting up a GitHub account I realized very quickly that while it has many tools and is most likely a powerful 
driver for many, it can easily overwhelm someone if they don't have proper instruction. 

**Considerations**

When looking into the Programming Historian the first thought I have is a work space. This is a collaborative space 
meant for people who want to work on projects. So the space is designed for people to look at each other's work and 
collaboratively improve the work. Since there is only peer review and no "gold standard" to held to it is more like
a piece of art and less like a text book. 
What I mean by this is contained in the saying "art is never finished, only left". 

The PierceHacker attempts to do the same with a student body. This can be helpful but only if enough people work on it.

**Reflection**

My paragraphs above probably already contain some sense of what I've learned but to specify I'll go into what I've learned. 
Technical writing is the use of specific langauge and instructions to teach or allow other to follow along with work you have done or have knowledge of. 

There are a number of ideas on what constitutes good technical writing. Peer review only vs using editors. Also while it is fairly time consuming because you need to think about how to word things so that no one is lost on what you're explaining, I think I will be pretty good at this.
