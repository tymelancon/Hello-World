# Week Two

## Lego Project
In this I was looking at functionality and organization. I had ideas on what I wanted to do, but due to the limitations of markdown I 
wasn't able to do a few of them. This caused me to rethink how I was approaching the problem. Other people would move to other programs 
to solve the issues but I wanted to stick in the framework of Github. I did however use HTML for some of the more difficult problems. Such
as resizing images. 

An example of this was putting images side by side instead of just up and down. I didn't really enjoy making my list overly long but that
is what I had to work with and so I did. I think my project for the legos was actually pretty good, I had a few things that I would change 
in a step or two that would draw more attention to a certain part of the build and maybe an additional picture. Mostly this project gave
me a box in which to work on markdown. That is to say, I was given a number of toys in the sandbox and told to build something with them.

Given a goal I had something to work towards instead of just a tutorial that would go in one ear and out the other. 

## Guide to guides

For this one I called in more help. I think I want to do more than what the assignments call for from here on out. I also plan on starting
a pet project website and trying to learn more than just markdown. I want to be proficient in HTML and CSS. The perhaps ruby on rails or 
something like that. 

The actual assignment though taught me what mark down can do. My favorite thing was seeing what other people did with markdown and seeing 
if I could replicate it. Formatting and styling and such. I covered mostly what I learned in the assignment itself but, formatting, the
language itself, and legibility were all big factors that clicked.
