**Step One**

Begin by connecting both P.11 parts so that they are on top of each other evenly. 

**Step Two**

Take the even pieces of P.11 now that they are together and place them on the top side of P.10. You will place the combined P.11 one space from one side and leaving two spaces to the left and right of it. 

**Step Three**

Connect P.3 to the top of P.11 so that it is even on the back side. Then connect P.8 on P.11 leaving one space on each side. 

**Step Four**

Attach P.12 to the left and right space left on the top of P.11 with the wide bottom side. This will have the "wings" going outward. 

**Step Five**
