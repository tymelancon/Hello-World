**Step One**

Begin by connecting both P.11 parts so that they are on top of each other evenly. 

**Step Two**

Take the even pieces of P.11 now that they are together and place them on the top side of P.10. You will place the combined P.11 one space from one side and leaving two spaces to the left and right of it. 

**Step Three**

Connect P.3 to the top of P.11 so that it is even on the back side. Then connect P.8 on P.11 leaving one space on each side. 

**Step Four**

Attach P.12 to the left and right space left on the top of P.11 with the wide bottom side. This will have the "wings" going outward. 

**Step Five**

Place the two P.9 parts on the edges of P.12 and P.3. These will act as reinforcement against weight. 

**Step Six**

Place P.13 on top of P.3 and P.8 leaving a space to the left and right. At the edge of P.12 attach P.14 (x2).

**This completes the "Shamisen Stand" part of the build. Next we will build the Shamisen itself.**

**Step Seven**

Begin by attaching P.2 to the most narrow row of P.1. This will leave the two wider rows of P.2 open. 

**Step Eight**

On the under side of P.2 attach P.5 three rows deep. 

**Step Nine**

Attach P.4 vertically three rows deep on the top so that there is space for the other P.4 next to it. 

**Step Ten**

Starting at the top of P.4's side attach P.6 one space deep leaving one space inbetween each(x3). On the opposite side, leave one space empty and place P.7 one deep and leaving one space inbetween each (x2). 

**Step Eleven**

Place P.15 on top of P.2 towards the bottom one space from the edge, leaving one space to the left and right.
