# Week Five

## Survey
So, this week is a wrap up of both week four and five. In week four we constructed a survey for our upcoming Pierce Hacker Project. 
this included getting into groups and coming up with questions relevant to figuring out what people would want or need in the sphere 
of help guides. 

## Pierce Hacker 
With this project I wanted it to read like a business proposition. In the role play spirit of this assignment I went into it with a lot of
"we believe" or "for pierce hacker to be successful" statements. I really wanted to try and get into the headspace of writing this for 
a boss. Or at least sending this to someone for review. 

Once I got started I realized that I have some personal opinions on how this project should be run. For it to actually work I had to think 
problem solution style. There were questions that would have stopped the entire thing in it's tracks if I didn't come up with my own answers.
So it's not a purely objective document. There is definately room for opinion and suggestion.

I was looking at a few other drafts and I also realized that I had given basically no direct examples with my data. So while I had this
overview of how the project should work, I never gave any data. The whole point of the survey and I somehow missed that? So I added a 
section where I go into my personal ideas for how to guides and what the data is saying.
