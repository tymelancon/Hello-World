My name is Ty James MelancÇ«n. I worked in the IT industry for about eight years. I love cooking, reading, 
playing/recording music, playing D&D, and gaming of all sorts. 

When I initially walked in the idea was that Technical Writing was more about writing in a business setting. 
While that can be true the real intent was left untouched. 

When setting up a GitHub account I realized very quickly that while it has many tools and is most likely a powerful 
driver for many, it can easily overwhelm someone if they don't have proper instruction.
