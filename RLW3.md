# Week Three

## Survey
Honest this week was mostly discussion. As all things involving thirty people take more time than is needed we spent most of the
time talking about what questions to ask and where that information would get us. In my group there was a lot of back and forth 
which honestly I enjoy. It means there is an actual difference in opinion and so that leads to interesting talks on what is needed
for this sort of project. With no class on Friday as well there is less to talk about. I'm excited to see our data once we get it.
